# Cutting the Learning Curve with GPT

- GPT reduces the barriers to entry for code-based data visualization
- Assists users at every step, from data cleaning to app development
- Accelerates the learning process by providing code, but also it can explain what it's doing to you

# Why Transition to Coding for Data Visualization?

- Reusability: Code-based solutions make it easier to reuse and repurpose code for visualizations, saving time and effort. Example: Create a custom library/module for your organization's preferred graph style, easily share it, and update it as needed.
- Version control: Track changes and maintain a clear history of your work, facilitating collaboration, tracking changes, and being able to revert when you break stuff.
- Transparency and documentation: Coding lets you and others see what you've done, reducing the "black box" effect. More trustworthy and easier to build on.
- Separation of data and code: Keep your data and visualization code separate, making it easier to update and manage access to

# Overview of Data Visualization Ecosystems in Python and R

- Python libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Dash, Bokeh, Altair, Geopandas (for mapping)
- R libraries: ggplot2, Shiny, Plotly, lattice, leaflet (for mapping)
- Dashboards: Streamlit (Python), Flask (Python), Shiny (R)
- Both ecosystems provide powerful tools for creating static, interactive, and web-based visualizations, including mapping

# Data Cleaning and Input with GPT-generated Code

- GPT can generate code to import, filter, and preprocess data for your specific visualization needs
- Doing this via coding lets you scale with fewer errors -- for instance, if we have many files with similar structure, we can read in and aggregate them all at once
- This also makes it easier to update your visualizations when your data updates in an automated way (for instance, by having your figure titles reflect the most recent data)
---

# Generating Code for Graphs from Descriptions

- Input a text description of the desired graph or chart
- GPT outputs code for the specified visualization using libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, or plotly/dash
- Example: "Create a line chart showing the monthly revenue of an online store from January 2022 to December 2022"
- You can customize your formatting extensively, although it may not get everything correct immediately

# Learning and Debugging with GPT

- GPT writes high-quality code and explains its functionality, helping users learn best practices
- GPT assists with debugging by interpreting error messages and suggesting solutions
- Shortens the process of fixing issues and improves code quality

---

# App Development Assistance through GPT-generated Code

- GPT can also reduce the learning curve/write you code for creating interactive dashboards
- It can write you code, but also walk you through processes like where and how to deploy an app

# Conclusion

- Transitioning from drag-and-drop tools to code-based data visualization opens up new possibilities
- Python and R ecosystems provide a wide array of libraries and frameworks for creating powerful visualizations, including mapping
- GPT is a valuable assistant throughout the entire process, from data cleaning to app development
